# World-Energy-Production vs GDP Machine Learning Tester

The project is a simple tester for Linear Regression Machine Learning. Data for energy production of the World from the Years 1980-2021 was compared to GDP of the World for 1980-2021. The project involved some data cleanup and wrangling. This project was merely a proof of concept that the data was related enough. 

The hope was that the workflow could applied to a larger dataset (every country for 1980-2021) and also use future GDP predictions to form conclusions on future energy production.

#### The Data was also broken up into a 75%/25% train/test set just purely for observation. Due to the small amount of point theres not much room for inconsistently but the general workflow idea might be much more useful for the larger dataset so it was included in the proof of concept.
